/**
 * THE TWO REGISTERS THE INDEX RUNS IN.
 *
 * The about page has said "office hours / after hours" since it was written;
 * the index had no such distinction, so paid product work and unfinished
 * personal builds sat in one undifferentiated field of nine tiles and a reader
 * had to infer which was which from the tags. Same vocabulary, applied to the
 * work: it costs one line each and it is the difference between "nine projects"
 * and "four things she was hired to do, and five she does anyway".
 *
 * `key` matches the `category` already on every project in projects.ts, so the
 * split is data that existed rather than a new field to keep in sync.
 *
 * The `note` on after hours says "still being built" on purpose. These are
 * live and genuinely hers, but they are in progress, and a reader who finds
 * that out by clicking trusts the rest of the page less.
