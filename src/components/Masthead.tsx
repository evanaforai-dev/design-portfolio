/**
 * HOME MASTHEAD — the first ten seconds.
 *
 * The index below this is nine designed objects, and on its own it says
 * nothing about who made them or what they are for. Someone arriving from a
 * cold link had to infer "product designer" from nine thumbnails, or read it
 * off the browser tab. This band says it, once, and then gets out of the way.
 *
 * It is set as a masthead, not a hero: no full screen, no centred block, no
 * scroll cue, no portrait. One rule of type across the page and a rail of
 * facts against it, which is the same move the case studies make with their
 * title and metadata band.
 *
 * HEIGHT IS THE CONSTRAINT, NOT SPACE. The index measures itself against
 * whatever is left under this, and the index is the point of the page — every
 * pixel here is a pixel off a project's artwork. The rail is therefore set
 * with its labels INLINE rather than stacked above their values: three tight
 * rows instead of two blocks and a list. That is about forty pixels, which is
 * the difference between both bands fitting a laptop viewport and not.
