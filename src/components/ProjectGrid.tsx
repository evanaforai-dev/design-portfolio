/**
 * The index, in two registers.
 *
 * It used to be one undifferentiated field of nine tiles, ordered by how
 * interesting each one was and nothing else. A reader could not tell which of
 * them someone had paid for. Now it is two labelled bands — office hours, then
 * after hours — split on the `category` already carried by every project, so
 * the four pieces of client and company work are a complete first row and the
 * five self-initiated builds are a complete second one. Neither band ever
 * leaves a hole, because each is exactly as wide as it has projects.
 *
 * SCALE CARRIES THE HIERARCHY. Office hours runs four across and after hours
 * five, which makes the paid work physically larger on the page without
 * needing a badge, a border or a word to say so. The height each band gets is
 * proportional to its own column width, so both come out at the same aspect
 * ratio: two sizes of one thing, not two different things.
 *
 * FITS THE VIEWPORT ON A WIDE POINTER DEVICE. Both bands together are never
 * taller than the space between the masthead and the footer, so no project is
 * below the fold. When they cannot both fit at a readable size — a short
 * window, a tablet, a phone — the grid stops fitting and starts scrolling:
 * each band falls back to a column count taken from the width alone, and cells
 * take a square well instead of a solved height. Solving for a 375px viewport
 * produced nine 124x130px thumbnails with the titles clipped, which is the
 * whole index above the fold and none of it legible.
 *
 * Border technique (no doubled lines): each band draws its own top + left
 * frame; each cell draws only its right + bottom line, so the hairlines run
 * continuously across the band.
 *
 * Microinteraction — CURSOR-REACTIVE GRID: a second, masked copy of each
 * band's lines (`.reactive-grid-overlay`) fades up near the pointer. The base
 * geometry never moves; only local emphasis changes. Pointer tracking writes
 * CSS variables in a rAF loop (no React re-render), and the effect is disabled
 * on touch / reduced-motion devices.
 */

/*
 * Order within each band. Office hours leads with the internal operations
 * product, then the ai systems, then the service-design study, then the
 * financial products. Vision is first because it is the densest piece of
 * product work here and the one a platform team recognises as their own
 * problem: roles, permissions, views, state, and a migration run on live
 * money. Kochi1app sits ahead of wells fargo because it is the one that
 * shows the research: sixteen people tested, and a finding that disagreed
 * with the design. After hours is ordered by how much product thinking each
 * one carries, not by how pretty the tile is. Anything not listed still
 * renders, appended in data order, so adding a project to projects.ts is
 * enough to publish it.
